# hostinger_clone
this is hostinger clone for thapatechnical codefest. I created log-in page, home page, and not found page.


#sorry for some mistakes.
when i upload this project on night 11:30 i found some problem in this file. and i did on of them right.
1. I found that I wrote by mistake overflow-y: hidden; in place of overflow-x: hidden; and i correct it.
2. When I open this website on my phone with netlify link then i see i need give more padding to navbar from top side.


thanks.
